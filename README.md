A simple homemade kernel for RaspberryPi 4 (BCM2711) from scratch.

This project is my implementation of the step-by-step guide on how to create a simple operating system (OS) kernel from scratch prepared by [Sergey Matyukevich](https://github.com/s-matyukevich). While I followed his guide word for word, the original version was created for RaspberryPi 3 which unfortunately has a a different SoC (BCM2835). This required me to make some small but important changes.
